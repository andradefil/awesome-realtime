## SNS as source of processor

> On AWS using SNS to fan out to multiple SQS queues is a common scenario. SNS fan out means creating a SQS queue for each consumer of an SNS message and subscribing each SQS queue to the SNS topic. This means when a message is sent to the SNS topic a copy of the message arrives in each consumerâ€™s queue. It gives you multicast messaging and the ability to consume messages at your own pace and allowing you to not be online when a notification occurs.

## DynamoDB as storage
> Dynamodb has high performance as storage (... continue) 

Stack
* SNS 
* SQS
* Apache Kafka + Kafka Connectors
* DynamoDB

The local setup to run is based in docker-compose

## Run
> docker-compose up --build
